## 11/3/2025 - the whole damn thing (almost)  

I made the blender file, suffered through setting up git and github for the first time and that's that. Havent 3d printed yet. I also asked someone on slack if a 3D printed  blender project is enough, it is (from what i understood)

Gonna try 3D printing it tomorrow

## 11/8/2025 - Changed the model, started printing  

So i changed up the model and made something so i can actually screw in or however ill make the support thing stay in the walls. Made two things that i cant describe without saying they're supposed to look like eyelashes, placed on each "side" of the spray paint holder. They're supposed to look like eyes cuz, in the middle of their kinda "inside", ill graffiti pupils. so, tired eyes with eyelashes. probably red or blue pupils, ill think about it.

Screenshot of the model:
