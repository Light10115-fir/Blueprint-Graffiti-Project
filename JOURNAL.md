## 11/3/2025 - the whole damn thing (almost)  

I made the blender file, suffered through setting up git and github for the first time and that's that. Havent 3d printed yet. I also asked someone on slack if a 3D printed  blender project is enough, it is (from what i understood)

Gonna try 3D printing it tomorrow
